# About

This is a _sample_ book written in **Markdown**. You can use anything that Pandoc's Markdown supports; for example, a math equation $a^2 + b^2 = c^2$.

```{r}
library(leaflet)
```

Don't miss Figure \@ref(fig:nice-tab).

```{r nice-tab, fig.cap="Figure"}
leaflet() %>%
  addProviderTiles(providers$CartoDB) %>%
  addMarkers(lng=174.768, lat=-36.852, popup="The birthplace of R")
```
